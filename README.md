# TilePathfinder
This project is made based on Ryisnow's tutorials about making 2D game. His channel https://www.youtube.com/c/RyiSnow 

I followed his tutorials, did a lot of changes and adapted it to suit my project !!

TilePathFinder works like a 2D maze game. Move the block around the map on the Green tiles, to reach the *destination point.* (Yellow tiles represent walls, which you can't pass through.)
The map can be zoomed in and out, centered on the player, and the moving camera allows for navigation around the map.
